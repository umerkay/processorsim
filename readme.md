# About the Project

Assembly language programming and its thorough understanding is a great asset for a Computer Science undergraduate. Experience in programming using lower-level or assembly languages gives an insight into computer architecture and computer organization that is highly valuable. 

### Task1: 

You need to write a program with easy to graphical use interface in the programming language of your choice that will simulate the behavior of 8088/8086 processor. The program should include the conversion from assembly language to machine code as per the book (implement at least 15 different instructions with different operands). 
The program should show display the contents of the registers and memory (for simplicity you can use 8 registers and 16 memory locations). 
The program should also give error in case of not allowed instructions like size mismatch etc.

### Task 2: 

Choose a simple circuit of 8086/88 (preferably circuit but you can also use block diagram) The simulator should also highlight the cycles or modules (like ALU, Memory etc.) used in the current instruction.

### Prerequisites

These programs are intended for those who are familiar with assembler, or have a bit of idea about it. Of course if you have knowledge of some other programming language (Basic, C/C++ ...) that may help you a lot.
